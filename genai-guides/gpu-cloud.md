Looking to catalog GPU cloud options for private instance encoders, LLM inference, model training, etc. Will include notes on startup or research programs, e.g. with free credits or deep discounts

Modal.com - apply for $50K startup/research free credits

Runpod

[Lambda Labs](https://lambdalabs.com)

Vast.ai

[Pump.co](https://www.pump.co/) is an interesting option. Seems like an interesting way to maybe save money if considering using the hyperscaler clouds such as AWS or GCP for GPU.

Note: I know [MLOps Community](https://home.mlops.community/) is working on a GPU cloud buyer's guide. Will keep an eye out for that.
